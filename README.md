# MoMath Hackathon 2017: Be Green
#### Saving the Earth One Tile at a Time

Math Square Behavior

Jackie Woo and Greg Kimatov

## The Math
Exploring discrete math to encourage the development of a logical and clear way to solve the problem (described below) in the fewest possible moves, if a solution exists.

## The Submission
All of these tiles have a green side and a white side. You are only allowed to flip adjacent tiles. The goal of Be Green is to flip all the tiles on a row to their green side. Depending on the randomly chosen inital color of the tiles (green or white), there may or may not be a solution. To play the game, participants will step on adjacent tiles to switch the tiles' colors.
We hope that participants will be able to find the 'trick' for knowing which rows can be solved and which cannot. We also hope that as they continue playing Be Green, they will challenge themselves to find the least possible number of moves to solve a row if it has a solution.

## Notes
There is a small bug where the tile colors doesn't switch one time when a participant stands on adjacent tiles; they keep switching rapidly between green and white.
We also noticed that sometimes the participant steps are sometimes not detected when the program is first run. We advise that you let the program run for about 15 seconds and test it again.
